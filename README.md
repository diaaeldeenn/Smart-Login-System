## 🧠 Overview  

This project started as a simple task, but evolved into a fully functional front-end application —  
focused on **real-world structure**, **clean logic**, and **modern UI principles**.

It follows a clear separation between logic and design (**Separation of Concerns**),  
ensuring maintainability, readability, and scalability.

## ✨ Features  

✅ **Full Login / Register / Home flow** using LocalStorage  
✅ **Clean modular code** (single JS + shared CSS)  
✅ **Custom form validation** built from scratch  
✅ **Animated Glassmorphism interface** with neon highlights  
✅ **Smooth transitions & subtle hover effects**  
✅ **Responsive layout** for all screen sizes  
✅ **Accessible design** with focus-friendly components

## 🛠 Tech Stack  

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – Modern styling + animations  
- **Bootstrap 5** – Layout & responsiveness  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – Logic, validation, storage  
- **Font Awesome** – Iconography

## 🧱 Core Concepts  

- **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** logic and UI handled independently for cleaner, scalable code.  
- **LocalStorage Integration:** mimics backend persistence without a database.  
- **User Experience Focus:** smooth feedback, transitions, and responsive design.  
- **Maintainable Structure:** consistent naming, modular setup, and organized assets.

## 🧑‍💻 Development Notes  

Every animation, validation, and modal was hand-coded —  
focusing on clarity, intent, and attention to detail.  

No frameworks. No shortcuts.  
Just clean front-end engineering and thoughtful design.
